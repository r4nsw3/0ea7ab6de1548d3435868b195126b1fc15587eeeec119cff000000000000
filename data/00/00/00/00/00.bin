  |   Hotline Miami Collection contains both legendary games in the         |
  |   neon-soaked, brutally-challenging Hotline Miami series from           |
  |   Dennaton Games.                                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Hotline Miami is a high-octane action game overflowing with raw       |
  |   brutality, hard-boiled gunplay and skull crushing close combat. Set   |
  |   in an alternative 1989 Miami, you will assume the role of a           |
  |   mysterious antihero on a murderous rampage against the shady          |
  |   underworld at the behest of voices on your answering machine.         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is the brutal conclusion to the         |
  |   Hotline Miami saga, set against a backdrop of escalating violence     |
  |   and retribution over spilled blood in the original game. Follow the   |
  |   paths of several distinct factions - each with their own              |
  |   questionable methods and uncertain motivations - as unforeseen        |
  |   consequences intersect and reality once again slips back into a       |
  |   brilliant haze of neon and bloodshed.                                 |
  |                                                                         |

  |   This game, similar to our release of                                  |
  |   Grandia_HD_Collection_eShop_NSW-VENOM is also a "special" game        |
  |   which has multiple contents in one which some installers don't        |
  |   support. Thus, the same problem as Grandia will occur if you try to   |
  |   install this with the built in SXOS Installer. Like for Grandia, we   |
  |   also recommend you to use the old Tinfoil to install it, but we've    |
  |   heard mixed results with Goldleaf 0.5 and newer Tinfoil. Be           |
  |   cautious on the installer you are using.                              |
